This project is a Tokenizer for C++ written in C++. 
The default input file is the Tokenizer.cpp file, which is
also the source file for the Tokenizer class. 

To run, just compile the main.cpp, Tokenizer.cpp, and Token.cpp
files. If you want to parse another input file, supply it 
as a command line argument when running the executable. 
All Tokens, and their Lexemes will be printed out until 
the program reaches the end of the file.
